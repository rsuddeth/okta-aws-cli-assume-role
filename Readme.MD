# Okta AWS CLI Assume Role tool

This repo is forked from https://github.com/oktadev/okta-aws-cli-assume-role.   

**Disclaimer:** This tool is community-supported and is maintained by members of the Okta team
for developers and IT professionals. This tool is not an official Okta product and does not qualify for any
Okta support. Anyone who chooses to use this tool must ensure that their implementation meets any applicable legal
obligations including any Okta terms and conditions.

Changes were made to the `pom.xml` in this fork, to use a newer version of openjfx.
This is because version 12 (specified in okta-dev's repo) did not support it.

See https://maven.apache.org/pom.html for more info about the apache maven configuration.
